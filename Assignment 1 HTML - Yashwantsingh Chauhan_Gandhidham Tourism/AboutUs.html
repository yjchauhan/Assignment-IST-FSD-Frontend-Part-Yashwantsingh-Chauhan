            Soon after India's partition in 1947, a considerable number of Sindhi Hindu refugees from Sindh, Pakistan, came to India. His Highness Maharao Shri Vijayrajji Khengarji Jadeja, Maharaja of Kutch, donated 15,000 acres (61 km<sup>2</sup>) of land to Bhai Pratap, who established the Sindhu Resettlement Corporation Ltd. (SRC) to rehabilitate Sindhi Hindus who moved from Sindh to Pakistan.

            Acharaya Kriplani was appointed chairman and Bhai Pratap Dialdas was appointed managing director of the Sindhu Resettlement Corporation Ltd. The corporation's major purpose was to assist displaced individuals in finding new homes by constructing a new township. The initial concept was created by a team of planners led by Dr. O. H. Koenigsberger, director of the Government of India's housing division. Adams Howard and Greeley Company later altered the concept in 1952. In 1947, the town's foundation stone was laid with Gandhi's approval. As a result, the town was given the name Gandhidham. Bhai Pratap offered a 25-paisa incentive to kill scorpions and a 50-paisa incentive to kill snakes in order to clean up the desert where it was erected. The initial design was for 400,000 people to live in the town, with half of them arriving by the mid-1970s. A new design called for three stages of town growth, with the middle stage lasting longer and housing around 150,000 people.
